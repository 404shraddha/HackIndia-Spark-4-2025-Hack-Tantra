##Debatrix – Turn Arguments into Victories

#Inspiration

People argue online all the time—on Twitter, Instagram, and forums—whether it’s about serious topics, niche interests, or just for fun. However, these arguments rarely have structure, accountability, or rewards. *What if we could gamify this and turn it into a skill-based competition where users can earn rewards for winning arguments?*

#Project

Debatrix is a decentralized, skill-based argument *game* where users engage in structured debates, stake tokens, and win rewards based on AI-judged outcomes. It brings structure, fairness, and incentives to online arguments, making debates more engaging and competitive.

#How It Works

1. *Enter the Debate Arena:* Two users join a debate room and connect their Web3 wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.).

2. *Stake Tokens:* Both participants stake Solana tokens, forming the prize pool.

3. *AI-Generated Topics:* The AI judge randomly generates a debate topic based on user-selected categories.

4. *The Debate Begins:* Users argue their points in a structured format.

5. *AI-Based Judging:* The AI evaluates arguments based on factual accuracy, logical strength, and persuasiveness.

6. *Winner Takes All:* The AI declares a winner, who claims the entire prize pool.

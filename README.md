# Debatrix – Turn Arguments into Victories

## Inspiration
People argue online all the time—on Twitter, Instagram, and forums—whether it’s about serious topics, niche interests, or just for fun. However, these arguments rarely have structure, accountability, or rewards. 

**What if we could gamify this and turn it into a skill-based competition where users can earn rewards for winning arguments?**

## Project
**Debatrix** is a skill-based argument game where users engage in structured debates, stake tokens, and win rewards based on AI-judged outcomes. It brings structure, fairness, and incentives to online arguments, making debates more engaging and competitive.

## How It Works
1. **Enter a Debate Room**: Users join a virtual debate room, matched with an opponent.
2. **Stake Coins**: Each participant wagers in-game coins to a stake pool.
3. **AI-Generated Topics**: Topics are randomly generated based on selected categories.
4. **Live Debate**: Users argue in real time.
5. **AI-Based Judging**: The AI evaluates arguments based on **logic, persuasion, and factual accuracy**.
6. **Winner Takes All**: The AI announces the winner, who claims the wagered coins.
7. **Use Coins**: Winners can use their earnings to enter higher-stake debates or purchase detailed performance analysis.
